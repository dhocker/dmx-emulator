    The socket server creates one instance of this class for each
    incoming connection. That instance handles DMX data sent by a network client.

    The protocol is simple. The client sends a stream of data as if the
    server is a DMX system.

    Each transmission is (4h + 4d + 512b + 4t) bytes in length where h is a 4-byte
    header of zeroes, d is a 4-byte data length and t is a 4-byte trailer of 0xFF.
    The data length indicates how many bytes of the 512 byte body are valid. It's
    range is 1 to 512. Note that the body is ALWAYS 512 bytes.
